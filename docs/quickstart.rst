Quickstart
-------------

After installation of the application (and dependencies) has completed,
you should be able to start the application using the ``lifesospy_mqtt``
command.

When you run the application for the first time, it will create a new
configuration file and exit.

::

   lifesospy_mqtt v0.10.1 - MQTT client to report state of LifeSOS security system and devices.

   A default configuration file has been created:
   ~\.lifesospy_mqtt\config.yaml

   Please edit any settings as needed then restart.

Open up the new config file. For now, just fill out the details in the
:ref:`LifeSOS Settings <configuration_lifesos>` section.
